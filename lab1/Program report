Design Overview: 
                 1.Show basic information of each node
                 2.enable the node to collect information of other nodes incident to it.
                 3.Count the number of message the node received and transmittted

Program Status:   

The main difficulty is to fully understand the mechanism of CNET.
For example, each protacol is run independently except the flame,So menbers in self-design
structure belongs to each node itself, while menbers in flame can be share between two nodes. 
This is the key to design structure for storing information of neighbour and the overall algorithm.


Testing and Results:   

By using the topology files provided in coures webpage, the program can be tested 
under network with multiple nodes.When the time for sending message is short, its possible to encouter
runtime error.
