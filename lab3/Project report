                                PROJECT REPORT for lab3
Objectives:
        Help get used to routing algorithms and LAN protocols. Gain experience of testing 
        protocols.



Part1:

      1.seqno and MAXHOPS.
        initial seqno=0, initial MAXHOPS=4.
        It use  p.seqno = NL_nextpackettosend(p.dest) and define the macro of MAXHOPS.

      2. Yes.   
          When MAXHOPS = 1, Efficiency (bytes AL) / (bytes PL) = 34.23.
          When MAXHOPS = 2, Efficiency (bytes AL) / (bytes PL) = 16.82.
          When MAXHOPS = 3, Efficiency (bytes AL) / (bytes PL) = 9.82

          Overall,as MAXHOPS increase, the efficiency decrease.

      3. It computes all links except the one that it arrives by returning an int indicating
      the link desired.  


Part2:
        Design Overview:
            1 This protocol support two modes of operation, with or without  carrier sensing
            by settng a control variable

            2 This protocol implement Ethernet CSMA/CD Algorithm by using Exponential Backoff
            to control pattern of retransmission.

            3 Only one  LAN controller is kept, and it performs different functionality mainly
            depending on the activity state

        Program Status:
              Program works good with no error occur. 
              
              Its important to figure out what exactly need to do 
              in order to update the state of lanc.

        Testing:
               test by changing the cs_flag and printing error info in output files

        Result:
        For cs_flag= 0

        With cs_flag set, the performance has been obviously improved such that no frame collisions occurs
        and no frame would be dropped.
